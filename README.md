# Getting Started with Create React App using TypeScript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/manishbajagai2/data-visualization-task.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd data-visualization-task
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
